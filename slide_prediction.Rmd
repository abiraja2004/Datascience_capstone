## Introduction

This little text predictor was created for the last project of the Data Science capstone whichis a seven week course that is a part of the Data Science specialization. The aim of the project is to create a text prediction algorithm -- based on the datasets supplied to us (from twitter, blogs and news articles)-- which will take an incomplete sentence and give you the next word in that sentence. 

## Exploratory analysis

During the first few weeks, we had to get the data, clean it and perform some simple exploratory analysis on the data
It also includes the n-grams model that was tested and accepted for creation of the app and contains a word cloud and bar garph of uni,bi,tri grams. After which in order to make it fastere, the sample size for the model was reduced

## Algorithm used - n-gram model

- In the fields of computational linguistics and probability, an n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech. The items can be phonemes, syllables, letters, words or base pairs according to the application. The n-grams typically are collected from a text or speech corpus. When the items are words, n-grams may also be called shingles. 

## App
- The app is hosted on Shiny app hosted on shiny apps.io, where it takes an input of and predicts the next word: https://preethical.shinyapps.io/Datascience_capstone_Predict_next/
The app requies for it the server.r and ui.R files as well as the method.R file which in term uses the output from the grams.R file (uni,bi,tri and fourgram.RDa)
