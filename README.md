The following are the files neccesary to run this text prediction app

After which please go to the folder named text_predictor and run and ui and server.R programs to get the model and the predictor app up and running. 

Along with that capstone_assignment_2.rmd and html is the report which looks at the ngrams and their frequencies, these were created in response to the earlier assignments.
